\section*{Abstract}
The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are proteins that catalyse the attachment of specific amino acids to their code-specified tRNA binding sites.  The enzymes therefore have direct relevance to the genetic code \cite{Woese}, and they have popped up 
among other research as well, including in medicine \cite{MalariaProlyl}.
The aaRSs phylogenies have been investigated and described previously \cite{aaRSphylogeny1999} \cite{aaRSphylogeny2017}.  However, for the first time we have taken into account the structural information of the proteins, using it to inform the alignments from which the phylogenies are inferred.

\section*{Introduction}
The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are divided by their core structures into two distinct classes, are fundamental to understanding the origin of the genetic code \cite{Woese}.

Previous phylogenetic analyses of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been performed \cite{aaRSphylogeny1999} \cite{aaRSphylogeny2017}, but the ability of traditional sequence alignment tools such as Clustal, MUSCLE, etc., falls short of 
incorporating vital structural information.  The unique conservation of the aaRS relies in their structural integrity and is difficult to assess by sequence alignments alone.  

Therefore, to better capture the phylogenetic relationships between each of the aaRSs, we align each aaRS by their structure, which provides us with the sequence alignment used for the phylogenetic inference.  
We use structural data provided by x-ray crystallography [CITE?] and supplement these data with structural information provided Modeller \cite{Modeller}, which aligns sequences obtained from GenBank with known aaRSs and infers their structures.
With a diversely sampled dataset, we align the proteins by structure using Partial Order Structure Alignment (POSA) \cite{POSA} \cite{POSA1}.  This provides us with sequence alignments.  We hone in on the most conserved regions [CITE] and perform 
Bayesian phylogenetic inference on these conserved regions using BEAST 2 \cite{BEAST2}.

The pipeline is shown in Figure \ref{pipeline}.

\section*{Materials and methods}
\subsection*{X-ray crystallography structures}



\subsection*{Modelling structures}
To ensure a statistically significant and diverse dataset, we gathered additional amino acid sequences from GenBank.  
We selected 20 organisms from each of the 3 domains of life, sampling from as many distinct clades as possible along the tips of the tree of life found in Figure \ref{treeoflife} [from: \hyperref[label_name]{``http://tolweb.org/Eukaryotes/3''}]. 
The result of our sampling is shown in Figure \ref{sampledtree}.

We used the ``protein homology detection and protein structure prediction" program HHpred \cite{HHpred} and Modeller \cite{Modeller} to provide 3D structures to the aaRS data from the GenBank database.  
HHpred, which is available through the online server (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/\#/) searches the database for known structures that closely match the input queries (i. e., our GenBank sequences).  
It feeds its produced alignment with the known structures to Modeller, which infers structures for the input queries based upon the known structure.

We align the modelled structures with the aaRS structures obtained by x-ray crystallography.  This ensures a more complete dataset.

\subsection*{Structural alignments}


The advantage of Partial Order Structure Alignment (POSA) is that, by utilizing partial order graphs which record one or more possibilities at each position in an alignment, POSA allows for flexibility in the way it estimates structural divergence. \cite{POSA} 
Distinctively, POSA is able to detect conserved regions within a subset of the input structures rather than those which are universally conserved.  In addition, POSA distinguishes internal structural arrangements in the proteins. \cite{POSA} 


Unfortunately, we are unable at this time to perform phylogenetic analysis directly on structural alignments, so to get the POSA alignments into a format we can use, we had to convert the partial order alignments it outputs into simple FASTA files.

A partial order alignment is shown in Figure \ref{POA} [from: ``http://github.com/ekg/glia"].  The difference between this type of alignment and ones used for phylogenetic inference and more typically shown and output by alignment tools is that

\subsection*{Phylogenetic inference}

\textit{Bayesian inference}
Based on Bayes' theorem \cite{Bayes}, Bayesian inference supplies straight-forward measures of uncertainty in its posterior probabilities and credible intervals.  
In classical, or frequentist, statistics the premise is that parameters are fixed and data are random.  Therefore, they report confidence intervals, which show a range of values to include the true value of some parameter with a minimum probability (e. g., 95\%).
Bayesians, on the other hand, believe that probability is fundamentally measuring the degree of certainty and thus the parameters are random and the data are fixed. The credible interval is used to denote the range of values that include some percentage (e. g., 95\%) of the probability. \cite{}
In other words, a frequentist designs an experiment to produce a number of trials in which the data (in this case, the sequence data) changes from each trial to the next and then looks for the confidence interval that includes, say, 95\% of the true parameter value (a ``true" tree, or phylogeny, in this case).  
A Bayesian takes the provided (sequence) data as a \textit{given} and then computes probabilities of different parameter values (which describe the possible tree topologies) that could explain the data.
The credible interval, then, is the way to describe how certain or uncertain we are about the answers that were inferred. \cite{PPinBayesianPhylogenetics}

The power of Bayesian statistics in phylogenetics has sparked interest among a growing community of researchers over the years. \cite{Huelsenbeck} \cite{HolderLewis} \cite{MammalRadiation} \cite{EarlyMammals} \cite{MissingData} \cite{SPREAD} \cite{MammalDiversification} \cite{SampledAncestors} \cite{Phylodynamics}
In particular, the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) software provides a framework for relatively easy introduction of new models and parameterizations in its statistical framework for the analysis of countless evolutionary questions. \cite{BEAST} \cite{BEAST1point7} \cite{BEAST2}.
Because of the nature of the Bayesian approach, it permits the ability to incorporate prior knowledge (e. g., past population dynamics) into the inference by using it to generate a prior probability distribution to indicate where the true parameter values probably exist.  
If not much is known previous to the analysis, these things can simply be inferred and the prior distribution is not heavily weighted.

\textit{MCMC}
\cite{MCMC}
MCMC efficiency \cite{MCMCefficiency}

\textit{Bayesian phylogenetics} The Bayesian method to phylogenetic inference attempts to obtain a posterior probability distribution of trees Pr($\tau,\theta|D$), where $\tau$ represents the trees sampled, $\theta$ is the substitution model, and $D$ is the data.  In our case, the data is the sequence alignment of amino acids which was produced by structurally aligning the aaRSs.
The prior distributions Pr($\tau|\theta$)Pr($\theta$), which represent the prior knowledge available to the researcher, are combined with the likelihood calculation Pr($D|\tau$).  \cite{PPinBayesianPhylogenetics} The full equation, then is

\begin{eqnarray}
\Pr(\tau,\theta|D) = \frac{\Pr(D|\tau,\theta)\Pr(\tau|\theta)\Pr(\theta)}{\Pr(D)},
\label{eq:posterior}
\end{eqnarray}
where Pr($D$) is a normalization constant which can be ignored.


%\begin{eqnarray}
%\ f(\tree,\traj,\eta, \theta | D) = \frac{\Pr (D|\tree,\theta) f(\tree|\traj,\eta) f(\traj |\eta) f(\eta) f(\theta) }{\Pr(D)},
%\label{eq:posterior}
%\end{eqnarray}

\textit{Molecular Clock}
A strict molecular clock with invariable rates would be inappropriate for our dataset, given the breadth of time our phylogenies span, from present-day stretching all the way to before the divergence of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) that connects the three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya. 
We are not particularly interested in the branches near the tips, which distinguish the species, but the fact that the rates of evolution within these branches should be vastly different than those which fixed into populations billions of years in the past cannot be ignored.  Therefore, we chose to use a 
relaxed molecular clock to allow the rate at which mutations fixed into the populations - i. e., the rate of evolution - to vary. \cite{RelaxedClockModelSelection}  With little information to go on concerning the effective population sizes throughout time, we chose a log normal distribution. 

\textit{Population dynamics and tree priors}
Bayesian skyline models yield information about past population dynamics without the need to parameterize with differential equations, and so allow us to estimate the population dynamics rather than making assumptions for which we have limited prior knowledge. \cite{coalSky} \cite{BDSKY}

\textit{Other methods}  There are other methods of analyzing molecular data to infer phylogenies. [CITE CRITICISMS oF BAYES HERE] In maximum likelihood \cite{Guindon}, the likelihood calculation Pr($D|\tau$) is the sole piece of the inference and yields one tree that maximizes the likelihood.  Rather than posterior probabilities, the branches of the tree are labelled with bootstrap values. \cite{HolderLewis}
Maximum likelihood trees are provided in the Supporting Information.

\section*{Results}

The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases group together in largely expected ways.  The aaRSs which catalyse the attachment of the branched-chain and non-polar amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine share a clade within the Class I phylogeny.
